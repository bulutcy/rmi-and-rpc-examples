This program is a basic RPC server and client.
Since it uses rpc standarts, some of the code is generated using [RPCGEN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPCGEN)
Server respondes incoming "TCP" and "IP" messages as "OK", otherwise as "NO".

Server source code:msg_prog.c
Client source code:rassignmsg.c

Server executable: msg_server
Client executable: msg_client

RPCGEN template file: msg.x

Compile command for server: cc msg_proc.c msg_svc.c -o msg_server -lnsl
Compile command for client: cc rassignmsg.c msg_clnt.c -o msg_client -lnsl

Running server from shell: ./msg_server
Running client from shell: ./msg_client HOSTNAME  (hostname may be localhost for test, or remote server)

Depending on your configiration, you may have to run with "sudo". Otherwise, they migth not be able to bind port.
